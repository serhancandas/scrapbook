    <h2>A Legend is Born</h2>
    <p>The Gibson Les Paul is a <strong>solid body</strong> electric guitar that was first sold by the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_(guitar_company)">Gibson Guitar Corporation</a> in 1952.The guitar was designed by factory manager John Huis 
        and his team with input from and endorsement by guitarist <strong>Les Paul</strong>. Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and 
        a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.</p>

    <p> The Les Paul was originally offered with a <span style="color:gold">gold finish</span> and two P-90 pickups. In 1957, humbucking 
        pickups were added, along with <span style="color:sienna">sunburst finishes</span> in 1958. The 1958â€“1960 sunburst Les Paul, today one of the 
        best-known electric guitar types in the world, was considered a commercial failure with low production and sales. </p>
